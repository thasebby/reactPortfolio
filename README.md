# React Portfolio

## Description
I created a portfolio to display some projects I have done, a short description of who I am, a way to download my resume and a way to communicate with me. All of this was done using React.

## Steps for build
* Used bootstrap for styling

* Created the whole project using a React framework

* I am able to display projects with direct links to GitHub repo and live website links


## Installation 
Run an 'npm i' to install all necessary dependencies and 'npm start' will start the code. This will send the user to a deployed website on a local host.
