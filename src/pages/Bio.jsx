                        Hi! my name is Sebastian Saenz. I have been working in the hospitality industry since
                        I was 16, where I developed a strong foundation in customer service,
                        communication, and problem-solving. My journey in hospitality has equipped me with
                        invaluable skills that I am eager to bring into the tech world.

                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>

                        Recently, I completed a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp through UCF, where
                        I gained hands-on experience with various technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        third-party APIs, MySQL, and the MERN stack. This intensive program honed my technical
                        abilities and prepared me for the challenges of software development.

                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>

                        I am excited to transfer the skills I have learned in the hospitality industry into the
                        software development industry. My background has instilled in me a knack for conflict resolution,
                        the ability to adapt swiftly to new situations, and a passion for continuous learning. These qualities, combined
                        with my newly acquired technical skills, position me well to create user-centric and efficient software solutions.

                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>

                        Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
